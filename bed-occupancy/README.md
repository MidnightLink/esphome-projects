# bed-occupancy

My first PCB design, very basic, using exclusively THT components and mostly pre-build modules.

This is mostly for archival purposes; I can't recommend using these components as I've had connectivity issues.

I had to rip out some of the reference models from the CAD drawings, because I don't have the rights to them.
This leaves the references all jumbled, sorry about that.
