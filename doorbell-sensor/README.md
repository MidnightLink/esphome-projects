# ESPHome Doorbell Sensor

This board is meant to go inside your doorbell/intercom (the old-school ones with a phone) and detect when the doorbell rings.
It uses an optocoupler to minimize modification to the existing electronics.

For now, I can't recommend using this with the ESP-01S as I've had connectivity issues.
I might redesign it to use an ESP-12F module in the future though.

No CAD drawings for this one, I just designed a super simple mounting plate that I glued to the intercom housing and seem to have deleted it afterwards.
