# ESPHome Velux Controller

This project has been edited to include USB C for power. Note that you must either use your own custom power supply, or use a USB A to C cable to get the 5V as it's just a connector and doesn't include any PD system

This project modifies a Velux KLI 310 or similar remote control to integrate with home assistant.
It replaces the back panel of the original remote, powers it from the wall, and can report state back to home assistant even if you press the physical buttons.

Installing it on the remote only requires removing the back and batteries, soldering 5 wires and plugging it into the control board. This process is nondestructive and reversible.

It runs on anywhere between 5V and 12V, though 5V is preferred.

I didn't need these, but you can add them if your ESP is unhappy with the supply voltage:

> Note: It isn't super obvious from the footprints, but these additional capacitors are supposed to mount horizontally against the board facing toward the bottom. If mounted vertically they may prevent the case from being closed.
